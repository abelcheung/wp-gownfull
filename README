==================
ABOUT
==================
GownFull is a cross-browser web-based input method engine, which allows
input of complex scripts (like Chinese) without any input method software
installed in OS.

WP-GownFull is a WordPress plugin adding GownFull support. This allows
people who is using English Windows, Linux or whatever platform to
enter comment in native language.

Right now GownFull only supports Chinese and Greek so far, but the list
of language will most certainly expand in the future.

==================

2. Upload or copy all files, including the 'im' subdirectory, into
   the above folder you created.
3. Activate the plugin in WordPress Plugin admin page.
