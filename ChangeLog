	* wp-gownfull.php:
	- Entire new file.

	* include_gownfull.php:
	* config.php:
	* getim.php:
	- Configuration simplification so they only boils down to installed
	input method and gownfull URL. Other config are only for one-time
	usage so hardcoded into include_gownfull.php and getim.php.
	- Config are stored in WordPress instead of config.php.
	- Allows selecting some IM to turn on, instead of always enabling all.
